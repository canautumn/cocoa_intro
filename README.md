# cocoa_intro

- This project includes some introduction project for Cocoa programming.
- Currently it comprises examples and exercises from the book [Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X 4e](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/cocoa-programming.html).
- The book is relatively old. 5e is expected to be available in April, 2015.
- The examples and exercises are redone in Xcode 6.1, OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.1. Most of the dated contents are replaced by newly implementations, especially methods that deprecated in OS X 10.10.
- This is a personal exercise. All passed under the above environment. However, best practices are not guaranteed.

# Cocoa Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 4e

- This folder contains examples and exercises from the book [Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X 4e](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/cocoa-programming.html).
- The book is relatively old. The new edition (5e) is available in Swift Language since April, 2015.
- The examples and exercises were done in Xcode 6.1, OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.1. Most of the dated contents in the book were replaced by newly implementations, especially methods that are deprecated in OS X 10.10.

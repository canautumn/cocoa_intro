# Stanford cs193p (Developing iOS8 Apps with Swift) Exercises

- This folder contains the assignments for Stanford open course cs193p (Developing iOS8 Apps with Swift, 2015 Winter) on iTunes U
- The projects are done using Swift 2.0 using Xcode 7.0 beta and will be updating to the latest version of Xcode until the new course is out. Therefore some of the syntax will be slightly different than that in the course material where Swift 1.0 was using.
